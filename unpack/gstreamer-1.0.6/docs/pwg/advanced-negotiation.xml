  <para>
    Caps negotiation is the act of finding a media format (GstCaps) between
    elements that they can handle. This process in &GStreamer; can in most
    cases find an optimal solution for the complete pipeline. In this section
    we explain how this works.
  </para>

  <sect1 id="section-nego-basics">
    <title>Caps negotiation basics</title>
    <para>
      In &GStreamer;, negotiation of the media format always follows the
      following simple rules:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          A downstream element suggest a format on its sinkpad and places the
          suggestion in the result of the CAPS query performed on the sinkpad.
          See also <xref linkend="section-nego-getcaps"/>.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          An upstream element decides on a format. It sends the selected media
          format downstream on its source pad with a CAPS event. Downstream
          elements reconfigure themselves to handle the media type in the CAPS
          event on the sinkpad.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          An upstream element can inform downstream that it would like to
          suggest a new format by sending a RECONFIGURE event upstream. The
          RECONFIGURE event simply instructs an upstream element to restart
          the negotiation phase. Because the element that sent out the
          RECONFIGURE event is now suggesting another format, the format
          in the pipeline might change.
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>
      In addition to the CAPS and RECONFIGURE event and the CAPS query, there
      is an ACCEPT_CAPS query to quickly check if a certain caps can
      be accepted by an element.
    </para>
    <para>
      All negotiation follows these simple rules. Let's take a look at some
      typical uses cases and how negotiation happens.
    </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="section-nego-usecases">
    <title>Caps negotiation use cases</title>
    <para>
      In what follows we will look at some use cases for push-mode scheduling.
      The pull-mode scheduling negotiation phase is discussed in
      <xref linkend="section-nego-pullmode"/> and is actually similar as we
      will see. 
    </para>
    <para>
      Since the sink pads only suggest formats and the source pads need to
      decide, the most complicated work is done in the source pads.
      We can identify 3 caps negotiation use cases for the source pads:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          Fixed negotiation. An element can output one format only.
          See <xref linkend="section-nego-fixed"/>.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          Transform negotiation. There is a (fixed) transform between the
          input and output format of the element, usually based on some
          element property. The caps that the element will produce depend
          on the upstream caps and the caps that the element can accept
          depend on the downstream caps.
          See <xref linkend="section-nego-transform"/>.
        </para>
      </listitem>

    <sect2 id="section-nego-fixed">
      <title>Fixed negotiation</title>
      <para>
        In this case, the source pad can only produce a fixed format. Usually
        this format is encoded inside the media. No downstream element can
        ask for a different format, the only way that the source pad will
        renegotiate is when the element decides to change the caps itself.
      </para>
      <para>
        Elements that could implement fixed caps (on their source pads) are,
        in general, all elements that are not renegotiable. Examples include:

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            A typefinder, since the type found is part of the actual data stream
            and can thus not be re-negotiated. The typefinder will look at the
            stream of bytes, figure out the type, send a CAPS event with the
            caps and then push buffers of the type.

        These types of elements also don't have a relation between the input

      <title>Transform negotiation</title>
      <para>
        In this negotiation technique, there is a fixed transform between
        the element input caps and the output caps. This transformation
        could be parameterized by element properties but not by the
        content of the stream (see <xref linkend="section-nego-fixed"/>
        for that use-case).
      </para>
      <para>
        The caps that the element can accept depend on the (fixed
        transformation) downstream caps. The caps that the element can
        produce depend on the (fixed transformation of) the upstream
        caps.
      </para>
      <para>
        This type of element can usually set caps on its source pad from
        the <function>_event()</function> function on the sink pad when
        it received the CAPS event. This means that the caps transform
        function transforms a fixed caps into another fixed caps.

      <para>
        Like with the transform negotiation in 
        <xref linkend="section-nego-transform"/>, dynamic negotiation will
        perform a transformation on the downstream/upstream caps. Unlike the
        transform negotiation, this transform will convert fixed caps to
        unfixed caps. This means that the sink pad input caps can be converted
        into unfixed (multiple) formats. The source pad will have to choose a
        format from all the possibilities. It would usually like to choose a
        format that requires the least amount of effort to produce but it does
        not have to be. The selection of the format should also depend on the
        caps that can be accepted downstream (see a QUERY_CAPS function in
        <xref linkend="section-nego-getcaps"/>).

            passthrough mode.

    <title>Upstream caps (re)negotiation</title>
    <para>
      Upstream negotiation's primary use is to renegotiate (part of) an
      already-negotiated pipeline to a new format. Some practical examples
      include to select a different video size because the size of the video
      window changed, and the video output itself is not capable of rescaling,
      or because the audio channel configuration changed.
    </para>
    <para>
      Upstream caps renegotiation is requested by sending a GST_EVENT_RECONFIGURE
      event upstream. The idea is that it will instruct the upstream element
      to reconfigure its caps by doing a new query for the allowed caps and then
      choosing a new caps. The element that sends out the RECONFIGURE event
      would influence the selection of the new caps by returning the new
      prefered caps from its GST_QUERY_CAPS query function. The RECONFIGURE
      event will set the GST_PAD_FLAG_NEED_RECONFIGURE on all pads that it
      travels over.

          answer the CAPS query with the new prefered format. It should be
          noted that when there is no upstream element that can (or wants)
          to renegotiate, the element needs to deal with the currently

      WRITEME, the mechanism of pull-mode negotiation is not yet fully
      understood.
    </para>

    <para>
      Using all the knowledge you've acquired by reading this chapter, you
