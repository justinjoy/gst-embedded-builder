  <title>Pipeline manipulation</title>
  <para>
    This chapter will discuss how you can manipulate your pipeline in several
    ways from your application on. Parts of this chapter are very
    lowlevel, so be assured that you'll need some programming knowledge
    and a good understanding of &GStreamer; before you start reading this.
  </para>
  <para>
    Topics that will be discussed here include how you can insert data into
    a pipeline from your application, how to read data from a pipeline,
    how to manipulate the pipeline's speed, length, starting point and how
    to listen to a pipeline's data processing.

    <title>Using probes</title>
    <para>
      Probing is best envisioned as a pad listener. Technically, a probe is
      nothing more than a callback that can be attached to a pad.
      You can attach a probe using <function>gst_pad_add_probe ()</function>.
      Similarly, one can use the
      <function>gst_pad_remove_probe ()</function>
      to remove the callback again. The probe notifies you of any activity
      that happens on the pad, like buffers, events and queries. You can
      define what kind of notifications you are interested in when you
      add the probe.
    </para>
    <para>
      The probe can notify you of the following activity on pads:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          A buffer is pushed or pulled. You want to specify the
          GST_PAD_PROBE_TYPE_BUFFER when registering the probe. Because the
          pad can be scheduled in different ways, it is possible to also
          specify in what scheduling mode you are interested with the
          optional GST_PAD_PROBE_TYPE_PUSH and GST_PAD_PROBE_TYPE_PULL
          flags.
        </para>
        <para>
          You can use this probe to inspect, modify or drop the buffer.
          See <xref linkend="section-data-probes"/>.

        <para>
          A bufferlist is pushed. Use the GST_PAD_PROBE_TYPE_BUFFER_LIST
          when registering the probe.

      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          An event travels over a pad. Use the GST_PAD_PROBE_TYPE_EVENT_DOWNSTREAM
          and GST_PAD_PROBE_TYPE_EVENT_UPSTREAM flags to select downstream
          and upstream events. There is also a convenience
          GST_PAD_PROBE_TYPE_EVENT_BOTH to be notified of events going both
          upstream and downstream. By default, flush events do not cause
          a notification. You need to explicitly enable GST_PAD_PROBE_TYPE_EVENT_FLUSH
          to receive callbacks from flushing events. Events are always
          only notified in push mode.
        </para>
        <para>
          You can use this probe to inspect, modify or drop the event.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          A query travels over a pad. Use the GST_PAD_PROBE_TYPE_QUERY_DOWNSTREAM
          and GST_PAD_PROBE_TYPE_QUERY_UPSTREAM flags to select downstream
          and upstream queries. The convenience GST_PAD_PROBE_TYPE_QUERY_BOTH
          can also be used to select both directions. Query probes will be
          notified twice, once when the query travels upstream/downstream and
          once when the query result is returned. You can select in what stage
          the callback will be called with the GST_PAD_PROBE_TYPE_PUSH and
          GST_PAD_PROBE_TYPE_PULL, respectively when the query is performed
          and when the query result is returned.
        </para>
        <para>
          You can use this probe to inspect or modify the query. You can also
          answer the query in the probe callback by placing the result value
          in the query and by returning GST_PAD_PROBE_DROP from the 
          callback.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          In addition to notifying you of dataflow, you can also ask the
          probe to block the dataflow when the callback returns. This is
          called a blocking probe and is activated by specifying the
          GST_PAD_PROBE_TYPE_BLOCK flag. You can use this flag with the
          other flags to only block dataflow on selected activity. A pad
          becomes unblocked again if you remove the probe or when you return
          GST_PAD_PROBE_REMOVE from the callback. You can let only the
          currently blocked item pass by returning GST_PAD_PROBE_PASS
          from the callback, it will block again on the next item.
        </para>
        <para>
          Blocking probes are used to temporarily block pads because they
          are unlinked or because you are going to unlink them. If the
          dataflow is not blocked, the pipeline would go into an error
          state if data is pushed on an unlinked pad. We will se how
          to use blocking probes to partially preroll a pipeline.
          See also <xref linkend="section-preroll-probes"/>.

      <listitem>
        <para>
          Be notified when no activity is happening on a pad. You install
          this probe with the GST_PAD_PROBE_TYPE_IDLE flag. You can specify
          GST_PAD_PROBE_TYPE_PUSH and/or GST_PAD_PROBE_TYPE_PULL to 
          only be notified depending on the pad scheduling mode.
          The IDLE probe is also a blocking probe in that it will not let
          any data pass on the pad for as long as the IDLE probe is
          installed.
        </para>
        <para>
          You can use idle probes to dynamically relink a pad.  We will see
          how to use idle probes to replace an element in the pipeline.

      <title>Data probes</title>
      <para>
        Data probes allow you to be notified when there is data passing
        on a pad. When adding the probe, specify the GST_PAD_PROBE_TYPE_BUFFER
        and/or GST_PAD_PROBE_TYPE_BUFFER_LIST. 
      </para>
      <para>
        Data probes run in pipeline streaming thread context, so callbacks
        should try to not block and generally not do any weird stuff, since
        this could have a negative impact on pipeline performance or, in case
        of bugs, cause deadlocks or crashes. More precisely, one should usually
        not call any GUI-related functions from within a probe callback, nor try
        to change the state of the pipeline.  An application may post custom
        messages on the pipeline's bus though to communicate with the main
        application thread and have it do things like stop the pipeline.
      </para>
      <para>
        In any case, most common buffer operations
        that elements can do in <function>_chain ()</function> functions, can
        be done in probe callbacks as well. The example below gives a short
        impression on how to use them.

        Strictly speaking, a pad probe callback is only allowed to modify the
        buffer content if the buffer is writable.  Whether this is the case or
        not depends a lot on the pipeline and the elements involved.  Often
        enough, this is the case, but sometimes it is not, and if it is not
        then unexpected modification of the data or metadata can introduce
        bugs that are very hard to debug and track down. You can check if a
        buffer is writable with <function>gst_buffer_is_writable ()</function>.
        Since you can pass back a different buffer than the one passed in,
        it is a good idea to make the buffer writable in the callback function
        with <function>gst_buffer_make_writable ()</function>.
      </para>
      <para>
        Pad probes are suited best for looking at data as it passes through
        the pipeline. If you need to modify data, you should better write your
        own GStreamer element. Base classes like GstAudioFilter, GstVideoFilter or
        GstBaseTransform make this fairly easy.
      </para>
      <para>
        If you just want to inspect buffers as they pass through the pipeline,
        you don't even need to set up pad probes. You could also just insert
        an identity element into the pipeline and connect to its "handoff"
        signal. The identity element also provides a few useful debugging tools
        like the "dump" property or the "last-message" property (the latter is
        enabled by passing the '-v' switch to gst-launch and by setting the
        silent property on the identity to FALSE).

        In a first step we will set a uridecodebin element to the PAUSED

        In a prerolled pipeline we can ask for the duration of the media
        and we can also perform seeks. We are interested in performing a

        that we are interested in.

      <para>
        After we configure the region we are interested in, we can link
        the sink element, unblock the source pads and set the pipeline to

        region is played by the sink before it goes to EOS.

    <title>Manually adding or removing data from/to a pipeline</title>
    <para>
      Many people have expressed the wish to use their own sources to inject
      data into a pipeline. Some people have also expressed the wish to grab
      the output in a pipeline and take care of the actual output inside
      their application. While either of these methods are strongly
      discouraged, &GStreamer; offers support for this.
      <emphasis>Beware! You need to know what you are doing.</emphasis> Since
      you don't have any support from a base class you need to thoroughly
      understand state changes and synchronization. If it doesn't work,
      there are a million ways to shoot yourself in the foot.  It's always
      better to simply write a plugin and have the base class manage it.
      See the Plugin Writer's Guide for more information on this topic. Also
      see the next section, which will explain how to embed plugins statically
      in your application.
    </para>
    <para>
      There's two possible elements that you can use for the above-mentioned
      purposes. Those are called <quote>appsrc</quote> (an imaginary source)
      and <quote>appsink</quote> (an imaginary sink). The same method applies
      to each of those elements. Here, we will discuss how to use those
      elements to insert (using appsrc) or grab (using appsink) data from a
      pipeline, and how to set negotiation.
    </para>
    <para>
      Both appsrc and appsink provide 2 sets of API. One API uses standard
      GObject (action) signals and properties. The same API is also
      available as a regular C api. The C api is more performant but
      requires you to link to the app library in order to use the elements.

    <sect2 id="section-spoof-appsrc">
      <title>Inserting data with appsrc</title>
      <para>
        First we look at some examples for appsrc, which lets you insert data
        into the pipeline from the application. Appsrc has some configuration
        options that define how it will operate. You should decide about the
        following configurations:

            Will the appsrc operate in push or pull mode. The stream-type
            property can be used to control this. stream-type of

            with the is-live property. When operating in live-mode it is
            important to configure the min-latency and max-latency in appsrc.
            The min-latency should be set to the amount of time it takes between
            capturing a buffer and when it is pushed inside appsrc.
            In live mode, you should timestamp the buffers with the pipeline
            running-time when the first byte of the buffer was captured before
            feeding them to appsrc. You can let appsrc do the timestaping with
            the do-timestamp property (but then the min-latency must be set
            to 0 because it timestamps based on the running-time when the buffer
            entered appsrc).

            be calculated so you must be sure you understand this. For
            live sources you probably want to set the format property to
            GST_FORMAT_TIME. For non-live source it depends on the media type
            that you are handling. If you plan to timestamp the buffers, you
            should probably put a GST_FORMAT_TIME format, otherwise
            GST_FORMAT_BYTES might be appropriate.

            If appsrc operates in random-access mode, it is important to configure

            This will allow downstream elements to know the size of the media and
            alows them to seek to the end of the stream when needed.

        The main way of handling data to appsrc is by using the function
        <function>gst_app_src_push_buffer ()</function> or by emiting the
        push-buffer action signal.  This will put the buffer onto a queue from
        which appsrc will read from in its streaming thread. It is important
        to note that data transport will not happen from the thread that
        performed the push-buffer call.
      </para>
      <para>
        The <quote>max-bytes</quote> property controls how much data can be
        queued in appsrc before appsrc considers the queue full. A filled
        internal queue will always signal the <quote>enough-data</quote>
        signal, which signals the application that it should stop pushing
        data into appsrc. The <quote>block</quote> property will cause appsrc to
        block the push-buffer method until free data becomes available again.
      </para>
      <para>
        When the internal queue is running out of data, the
        <quote>need-data</quote> signal is emitted, which signals the application
        that it should start pushing more data into appsrc.
      </para>
      <para>
        In addition to the <quote>need-data</quote> and <quote>enough-data</quote>
        signals, appsrc can emit the <quote>seek-data</quote> signal when the
        <quote>stream-mode</quote> property is set to <quote>seekable</quote>
        or <quote>random-access</quote>. The signal argument will contain the
        new desired position in the stream expressed in the unit set with the
        <quote>format</quote> property. After receiving the seek-data signal,
        the application should push-buffers from the new position.
      </para>
      <para>
        When the last byte is pushed into appsrc, you must call
        <function>gst_app_src_end_of_stream ()</function> to make it send
        an EOS downstream.
      </para>
      <para>
        These signals allow the application to operate appsrc in push and
        pull mode as will be explained next.

          When appsrc is configured in push mode (stream-type is stream or
          seekable), the application repeatedly calls the push-buffer method
          with a new buffer. Optionally, the queue size in the appsrc can be
          controlled with the enough-data and need-data signals by respectively
          stopping/starting the push-buffer calls. The value of the
          min-percent property defines how empty the internal appsrc queue
          needs to be before the need-data signal will be fired. You can set

      <title>Grabbing data with appsink</title>
      <para>
        Unlike appsrc, appsink is a little easier to use. It also supports
        a pull and push based model of getting data from the pipeline.
      </para>
      <para>
        The normal way of retrieving samples from appsink is by using the
        <function>gst_app_sink_pull_sample()</function> and
        <function>gst_app_sink_pull_preroll()</function> methods or by using
        the <quote>pull-sample</quote> and <quote>pull-preroll</quote>
        signals.  These methods block until a sample becomes available in the
        sink or when the sink is shut down or reaches EOS.
      </para>
      <para>
        Appsink will internally use a queue to collect buffers from the
        streaming thread. If the application is not pulling samples fast
        enough, this queue will consume a lot of memory over time. The
        <quote>max-buffers</quote> property can be used to limit the queue
        size. The <quote>drop</quote> property controls whether the
        streaming thread blocks or if older buffers are dropped when the
        maximum queue size is reached. Note that blocking the streaming thread
        can negatively affect real-time performance and should be avoided.
      </para>
      <para>
        If a blocking behaviour is not desirable, setting the 
        <quote>emit-signals</quote> property to TRUE will make appsink emit
        the <quote>new-sample</quote> and <quote>new-preroll</quote> signals
        when a sample can be pulled without blocking.
      </para>
      <para>
        The <quote>caps</quote> property on appsink can be used to control
        the formats that appsink can receive. This property can contain
        non-fixed caps, the format of the pulled samples can be obtained by
        getting the sample caps.
      </para>
      <para>
        If one of the pull-preroll or pull-sample methods return NULL, the
        appsink is stopped or in the EOS state. You can check for the EOS state
        with the <quote>eos</quote> property or with the
        <function>gst_app_sink_is_eos()</function> method.
      </para>
      <para>
        The eos signal can also be used to be informed when the EOS state is
        reached to avoid polling.

      <quote>caps</quote> property on this element. It will then

        It is also possible to dynamically change the format in a pipeline
        while PLAYING. This can simply be done by changing the caps 
        property on a capsfilter. The capsfilter will send a RECONFIGURE

    <title>Dynamically changing the pipeline</title>
    <para>
      In this section we talk about some techniques for dynamically
      modifying the pipeline. We are talking specifically about changing
      the pipeline while it is in the PLAYING state without interrupting
      the flow.
    </para>

      There are some important things to consider when building dynamic
      pipelines:

      <listitem>
        <para>
          When removing elements from the pipeline, make sure that there
          is no dataflow on unlinked pads because that will cause a fatal
          pipeline error. Always block source pads (in push mode) or
          sink pads (in pull mode) before unlinking pads.

          When adding elements to a pipeline, make sure to put the element
          into the right state, usually the same state as the parent, before
          allowing dataflow the element. When an element is newly created,
          it is in the NULL state and will return an error when it
          receives data.

          When adding elements to a pipeline, &GStreamer; will by default
          set the clock and base-time on the element to the current values
          of the pipeline. This means that the element will be able to
          construct the same pipeline running-time as the other elements
          in the pipeline. This means that sinks will synchronize buffers
          like the other sinks in the pipeline and that sources produce
          buffers with a running-time that matches the other sources.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          When unlinking elements from an upstream chain, always make sure
          to flush any queued data in the element by sending an EOS event
          down the element sink pad(s) and by waiting that the EOS leaves
          the elements (with an event probe).

          A live source will produce buffers with a running-time of the
          current running-time in the pipeline.
        </para>
        <para>
          A pipeline without a live source produces buffers with a
          running-time starting from 0. Likewise, after a flushing seek,
          those pipelines reset the running-time back to 0.
        </para>
        <para>
          The running-time can be changed with
          <function>gst_pad_set_offset ()</function>. It is important to
          know the running-time of the elements in the pipeline in order
          to maintain synchronization.

        <para>
          Adding elements might change the state of the pipeline. Adding a
          non-prerolled sink, for example, brings the pipeline back to the
          prerolling state. Removing a non-prerolled sink, for example, might
          change the pipeline to PAUSED and PLAYING state.
        </para>
        <para>
          Adding a live source cancels the preroll stage and put the pipeline
          to the playing state. Adding a live source or other live elements
          might also change the latency of a pipeline.
        </para>
        <para>
          Adding or removing elements to the pipeline might change the clock
          selection of the pipeline. If the newly added element provides a clock,
          it might be worth changing the clock in the pipeline to the new
          clock. If, on the other hand, the element that provides the clock
          for the pipeline is removed, a new clock has to be selected.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          Adding and removing elements might cause upstream or downstream
          elements to renegotiate caps and or allocators. You don't really
          need to do anything from the application, plugins largely
          adapt themself to the new pipeline topology in order to optimize
          their formats and allocation strategy.
        </para>
        <para>
          What is important is that when you add, remove or change elements
          in the pipeline, it is possible that the pipeline needs to
          negotiate a new format and this can fail. Usually you can fix this
          by inserting the right converter elements where needed.

      &GStreamer; offers support for doing about any dynamic pipeline
      modification but it requires you to know a bit of details before
      you can do this without causing pipeline errors. In the following
      sections we will demonstrate a couple of typical use-cases.
    </para>

    <sect2 id="section-dynamic-changing">
      <title>Changing elements in a pipeline</title>
      <para>
        In the next example we look at the following chain of elements:
      </para>
      <programlisting>
            - ----.      .----------.      .---- -
         element1 |      | element2 |      | element3
                src -> sink       src -> sink
            - ----'      '----------'      '---- -
      </programlisting>
      <para>
        We want to change element2 by element4 while the pipeline is in
        the PLAYING state. Let's say that element2 is a visualization and
        that you want to switch the visualization in the pipeline.
      </para>
      <para>
        We can't just unlink element2's sinkpad from element1's source
        pad because that would leave element1's source pad
        unlinked and would cause a streaming error in the pipeline when
        data is pushed on the source pad.
        The technique is to block the dataflow from element1's source pad
        before we change element2 by element4 and then resume dataflow
        as shown in the following steps:
      </para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Block element1's source pad with a blocking pad probe. When the
            pad is blocked, the probe callback will be called.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Inside the block callback nothing is flowing between element1
            and element2 and nothing will flow until unblocked.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Unlink element1 and element2.

        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Make sure data is flushed out of element2. Some elements might
            internally keep some data, you need to make sure not to lose data
            by forcing it out of element2. You can do this by pushing EOS into
            element2, like this:
          </para>
          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>
                Put an event probe on element2's source pad.
              </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
              <para>
                Send EOS to element2's sinkpad. This makes sure the all the
                data inside element2 is forced out.
              </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
              <para>
                Wait for the EOS event to appear on element2's source pad.
                When the EOS is received, drop it and remove the event
                probe.
              </para>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Unlink element2 and element3. You can now also remove element2
            from the pipeline and set the state to NULL.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Add element4 to the pipeline, if not already added. Link element4
            and element3. Link element1 and element4.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Make sure element4 is in the same state as the rest of the elements
            in the pipeline. It should be at least in the PAUSED state before
            it can receive buffers and events.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Unblock element1's source pad probe. This will let new data into
            element4 and continue streaming.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>
        The above algorithm works when the source pad is blocked, i.e. when
        there is dataflow in the pipeline. If there is no dataflow, there is
        also no point in changing the element (just yet) so this algorithm can
        be used in the PAUSED state as well.
      </para>
      <para>
        Let show you how this works with an example. This example changes the
        video effect on a simple pipeline every second.
